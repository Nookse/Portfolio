            <h1 class="titre1">Partie 1 - Preparation</h1>
                <p class="texte1">With my classmate Lino Lafore, we had decided to participate in the famous <strong>4L Trophy</strong>, a unique humanitarian and sporting adventure 🌍. 
                    <br><br> The first step in our preparation had been the <strong>creation of the "ECP Rapid'Occ" association</strong> to structure our project and facilitate administrative procedures 📝.  
                    <br> After finding our car 🚗, we had to repair it to pass a rigorous technical inspection, ensuring it was in perfect condition to face the challenges of the Moroccan desert 🏜️. 
                    <br> <br>Next, we undertook the search for <strong>sponsors to finance</strong> our adventure, making numerous contacts and presentations to convince companies to support us 💼. 
                    <br> In parallel, we <strong>created</strong> a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ecp-rapid-occ/"target="_blank"> LinkedIn</a> page dedicated to our project (which can be found by clicking on the photo above), allowing us to share our progress, attract the attention of potential sponsors, and build a community around our adventure. 
                    <br> <br>We were particularly proud to announce that we had succeeded in obtaining the support of <strong>Fabien Pelous</strong>, former player of the French rugby team and Stade Toulousain, as the sponsor of our project 🏉.</p>
            <h2 class="titre1">Partie 2 - Let's start !</h2>
                <p class="texte1">Participating in the 4L Trophy was an unforgettable adventure 🌍. 
                    <br>Upon arriving in <strong>Morocco</strong>, I realized the magnitude of challenges facing local communities, we:
                    <br> <br>- Visited remote villages 🏘️,
                    <br>- Distributed school supplies to children 📚,
                    <br>- Met with dedicated local associations 🤝.
                    <br><br>These experiences underscored the importance of <strong>mutual aid and solidarity</strong>. 
                    <br>Each encounter reminded me of the tangible impact we could make, fueling my commitment to further engage in humanitarian projects. 
                    <br> <br>This journey also highlighted how even <strong>small actions</strong> can profoundly change lives 🌳.</p>
            <h2 class="titre1">Partie 3 - Debrief</h2>
                <p class="texte1">After participating in the 4L Trophy, here are the <strong>key moments</strong> ✨ from this adventure:
                    <br> <br>- Mechanical preparation: 
                    We spent hours fixing our 4L to tackle the desert 🛠️. This taught me <strong>patience and the value of doing things right</strong>.
                    <br>- Administrative challenges: 
                    Creating our association and securing sponsors was a real administrative challenge 💼. I learned the importance of <strong>organization and perseverance</strong>.
                    <br>- Solidarity on the ground: 
                    <strong>Distributing school supplies</strong> to children and collaborating with local associations 📚 made me realize that every small action counts.
                    <br>- Teamwork among participants: 
                    <strong>Helping</strong> and <strong>being helped</strong> by other teams during breakdowns created strong bonds 🚙.
                    <br> <br>In conclusion, this experience taught me the importance of <strong>solidarity</strong>, <strong>commitment</strong>, and <strong>teamwork</strong>. 
                    <br> <br>These values will continue to inspire and guide me in all my <strong>future</strong> endeavors 🌍.</p>

                <p class="texte1">During my first three years at <strong>CESI 🏫</strong>, I had the opportunity to work on <strong>several projects</strong> focused primarily on hardware, often complemented by software development:
                    <br> <br><strong>🔊 Development of a Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker</strong>
                    <br> We started by designing and simulating the circuit using LTspice, then built a physical prototype on a breadboard before creating the final PCB design using KiCad.
                    <br> <br><strong>🌦️ Creation of a Weather Station using Arduino</strong>
                    <br>This project involved working with various sensors to gather environmental data and developing advanced software to manage and display the information.
                    <br> <br><strong>🔒 Design of an Electronic Safe</strong>
                    <br>Utilizing electronic components such as sensors, transistors, and resistors, we built the safe’s circuitry on a breadboard and controlled it with an Arduino board.
                    <br> <br><strong>⚡ Power Electronics Exploration</strong>
                    <br>We experimented with DC and AC motors, choppers, and DC machines, using tools like an oscilloscope and function generator to gain a deeper understanding of power electronics principles.
                    <br> <br>Additionally, for my <strong>personal projects</strong>, I recently acquired an Arduino kit with various electronic components to start exploring and working on different projects <strong>on my own. 🛠️</strong></p>
            <h2 class="titre1">Partie 2 - For the future</h2>
                <p class="texte1"><strong>🔭 Future Aspirations</strong>
                    <br>I am committed to advancing my skills in embedded electronics, starting with personal projects and later <strong>expanding</strong> this <strong>learning</strong> within a professional environment. 🚀
                    <br> <br><strong>💡 Expanding Knowledge Through Personal Projects</strong>
                    <br>This path will enable me to continuously grow my expertise in <strong>embedded electronics</strong>, ultimately allowing me to innovate and make meaningful contributions within a professional environment. 🛠️</p>

            <h1 class="titre1">Partie 1 - My participation</h1>
                <p class="texte1">Six months ago, <strong>Airbus</strong> offered me the opportunity to enroll in the <strong>Brevet d'Initiation Aéronautique</strong> (BIA). 
                    <br>It was a unique chance to learn more about the company, the aerospace industry, and broaden my general knowledge.
                    <br>The BIA program covers <strong>seven essential categories</strong>:
                    <br><br>- Meteorology and aerology: I gained insights into atmospheric phenomena and their impact on flight 🌦️.
                    <br>- Aerodynamics, aerostatics, and principles of flight: I explored the fundamental principles that allow airplanes to fly and stay stable in the air ✈️.
                    <br>- Study of aircraft and spacecraft: I discovered various types of aircraft and space technologies 🛰️.
                    <br>- Navigation: I learned the basics of air navigation, including tools and methods used for precise piloting 🧭.
                    <br>- Regulation and Flight Safety: I studied the strict rules governing aviation and practices ensuring flight safety 🚨.
                    <br>- Aeronautical and Space History: I also delved into the fascinating history of aviation and space exploration 🌌.
                    <br><br>This training not only enhanced my understanding of the <strong>technical aspects</strong> of my role at Airbus but also <strong>broadened</strong> my perspective on the <strong>aerospace industry</strong>. 
                    <br>It deepened my interest in this field and <strong>enriched</strong> my <strong>overall knowledge</strong> of the industry I work in.</p>
            <h2 class="titre1">Partie 2 - What I remember</h2>
                <p class="texte1">This experience with the BIA has been <strong>incredibly rewarding</strong>. 
                    <br> It has deepened my technical knowledge and provided me with a broader understanding of the <strong>aerospace industry</strong> ✈️. 
                    <br><br>I’ve gained valuable insights into how different elements, from meteorology to flight safety, come together to make aviation possible 🌍. 
                    <br>What I take away most from this experience is a <strong>stronger passion</strong> for the field, a better appreciation for the complexity of aviation, and a renewed commitment to my work at Airbus. 
                    <br><br>This journey has not only enriched my skills but also <strong>inspired me</strong> to continue learning and growing in the aerospace and space sectors 🚀.</p>
